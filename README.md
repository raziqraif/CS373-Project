Files:

  clean.py:

    Uses glove50.txt, pos.txt, and common.txt to generate data.txt. As the input
    files are too large for github, they are omitted from this repository.

  data.txt:

    Contains the cleaned and combined data. Each line is a sample, consisting of
    the word, its 50-dimensional GloVe representation, and whether it is a noun.
    These values are space-separated.
